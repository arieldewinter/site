In the writing groups I&amp;rsquo;m in, it&amp;rsquo;s primarily used as a way to build community, share thoughts and ideas, and discuss snippets of work for encouragement or advice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="markdown-and-you">Markdown and You&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Note that I said &amp;lsquo;&lt;em>snippets&lt;/em>&amp;rsquo;. For the vast majority of folks&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, the largest message you can send in a chat is 2000 characters. Because Discord also uses &lt;a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">the Markdown templating language&lt;/a> (the same type of text &lt;a href="https://github.com/arieldewinter/site/blob/main/content/blog/discord-as-a-tool-for-brevity.md?plain=1">this very post is (mostly) written in&lt;/a>), the formatting is included in the text, so any additional formatting counts against the character count.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scrivener and You</title><link>https://example.com/blog/scrivener-and-you/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2024 18:45:49 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/blog/scrivener-and-you/</guid><description>&lt;p>Stories take many forms: spoken word, written word, sung melody, campfire nostalgia, drunken retellings, plucked pain, solitary screams, incomprehensible babbling, the whispered chanting that echoes deep in your soul heralding the coming of Cthulhu, and even more that defy description.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Telling a story, on the surface, is simple: take the words out of your head and bring them into the world. With writing, the medium that we as writers use to bring the story into the world (oftentimes kicking and screaming) is the page. Now, what constitutes &amp;ldquo;the page&amp;rdquo; is up to interpretation: it could be an actual paper page that you write on, or it could be a computer screen that you type words on, or it could be a microphone that you dictate words to. What all those have in common is that they all eventually make your story accessible by people who aren&amp;rsquo;t you.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
