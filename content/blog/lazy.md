Today's prompt word is **lazy**![^1]

[^1]: The prompts are selected on a rotating basis by my friends in Discord! The rules are simple:
    * It can be any word, idea, or concept
    * Keep it interesting within the 2000-character limit that Discord imposes on a single message
    * Keep the editing to an absolute minimum
    
    You should give it a try too -- they're fantastic opportunities to practice storytelling in a small window of time. What can you come up with for **lazy**?

Soft clicking noises, low grunts, and the occasional hiss echoed through the room as the two women concentrated. Bella, a bead of sweat rolling slowly down her brow, concentrated as if her life depended on it; her fingers moved erratically, pressing and nudging seemingly without reason. Her lip curled as she sucked air through her teeth and grimaced.

Kim's carefree smile only increased Bella's building frustration. Though she struggled, Kim's hands were aided by years of experience; she knew this dance inside and out. Curve by curve, edge by edge, she was on her home turf now. Nothing Bella did (or didn't do) could throw her off her game now; she was in control.

Bella continued to sweat; she could _feel_ her heart rate rising and her concentration was suffering. Another mistake, another slip, another hiss. Second by agonizing second ticked by as the clicking continued; Bella wiped her brow with the back of her hand and swore softly under her breath.

Kim chuckled and cocked an eyebrow at the other woman in her bed; the maneuver went unnoticed by its intended recipient, but Kim didn't mind. This was her lazy time, her cue to sit back and just enjoy the world as she pulled the strings of the universe and watched the world dance.

Rage building, Bella finally threw her hands in the air and stared at Kim and her mischievous grin, stewing in her angst and irritation. The muscles in her neck pulsed as she worked her jaw, trying to find the words before her pulse raised higher. Seething, she bit out, "How the _fuck_ are you so good at Mario Kart??"
