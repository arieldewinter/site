Today's prompt word is **masquerade**![^1]

[^1]: The prompts are selected on a rotating basis by my friends in Discord! The rules are simple:
    * It can be any word, idea, or concept
    * Keep it interesting within the 2000-character limit that Discord imposes on a single message
    * Keep the editing to an absolute minimum
    
    You should give it a try too -- they're fantastic opportunities to practice storytelling in a small window of time. What can you come up with for **masquerade**?

"If you don't tell me why I should go, I will find something better to do with my time," Shannon growled hotly in my ear. "Like... you."

"_I'm_ not going to be here. I'm going to be at the party," I retorted, trying to ignore the heat in my stomach. Hot goth girls make the best girlfriends, and it's better when they're annoyed at you. Might not be your cup of tea, but it works for me.

"Amy. Baby. Little shit," she cooed, drawing a finger up my shoulder as I tried not to shiver. "Would you really _abandon_ me to go to this thing and play dress-up with strangers?" The whine in her voice carried an edge, and I knew that I had her in the palm of my hand.

"It's a costume party and the theme is masquerade, like I told you. All you really need is a mask, and I already got one for you, so you should come," I coaxed. "It'll be fun!"

Her flat stare told me everything. "That doesn't sound like fun."

"There'll be titties. We can ogle together." I reminded.

The stare became a little less flat. "You sound awfully sure about that."

"I have... insider knowledge."

The stare gained a slightly-raised eyebrow. "I'm listening."

"Yes, the party has a theme, but the dress code is very _welcoming_," I stressed. "You'd look hot as fuck in that little black leather bikini top."

"I'm already hot as fuck," she preened, picking at some invisible blight on her cleavage before flashing me a dazzling smile.

"Of course, I fully agree." I stood, then forced my way into her lap to straddle my human-shaped bundle of angst. "But your rack is amazing and I want an excuse to play with it." My roving hands caressed her skin as I pulled her into a deep kiss before biting her lip and pinching a nipple at the same time. "Just think about all the things you could do to me after we spend all night getting hot and bothered."

"Or... I could do all of those things to you now."

"Baby, you're nowhere near hot and bothered enough," I chided as I leaned in to nibble her ear with a grin.

"...Fine."
