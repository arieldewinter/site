Today's prompt word is **truth**![^1]

[^1]: The prompts are selected on a rotating basis by my friends in Discord! The rules are simple:
    * It can be any word, idea, or concept
    * Keep it interesting within the 2000-character limit that Discord imposes on a single message
    * Keep the editing to an absolute minimum
    
    You should give it a try too -- they're fantastic opportunities to practice storytelling in a small window of time. What can you come up with for **truth**?

"If you look hard enough, you can see the patterns in the lights," Stephanie gestured to the machine. "Okay, so let's try it again. Pull back on the plunger, then let it slip through your fingers."

He did as instructed, or at least tried; the ball flew from the plunger into the maze of lights and obstacles. It ricocheted around the cabinet, bouncing from bumper to spring to spinner. Steven tried frantically to stop the ball from escaping out the bottom, but grunted as it fell into the depths of the machine once more.

"Steph... I'm not sure this is the game for me. Pinball is fun, but I'm not very good at it."

"You only say that because you're not good _yet_," she responded, cupping his face in her thin hands and bringing his chin and eyes around to meet hers. "You'll get there, I have faith."

Their lips brushed together, the sensation bringing a smile to both faces. "One more try."

She slipped into his arms between his body and the machine, then guided his hand to the plunger again. "Play with me." Her hands moved to the sides of the machine over the buttons with his fingers resting lightly over hers.

"It's hard to focus when I just want to bury my face in your hair, you know," he teased as he nibbled her ear. "Sure, this is fun, but I'd rather play with _you_."

Stephanie smirked in response. "That's not what I meant, and you know it."

"Did you though? 'Cause I'm not so sure." Punctuating each word with a soft kiss on her auburn hair, he moved to the other side to nuzzle her neck. "You've mentioned this game is... intoxicating."

Her breath hitched as she leaned backwards into his chest. "Don't-- you said--" She exhaled softly. "Tell me the truth, do you want me to teach you more about pinball or not?"

"I absolutely do. You're hot as fuck when you nerd out."

"Steven!" She turned in his arms to face him, only to shriek as he wrapped his arms around her and lifted her onto on the pinball machine.

"I've always wanted to eat you out on one of these things."
