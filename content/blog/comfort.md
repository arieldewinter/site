Today's prompt word is **comfort**![^1]

[^1]: The prompts are selected on a rotating basis by my friends in Discord! The rules are simple:
    * It can be any word, idea, or concept
    * Keep it interesting within the 2000-character limit that Discord imposes on a single message
    * Keep the editing to an absolute minimum
    
    You should give it a try too -- they're fantastic opportunities to practice storytelling in a small window of time. What can you come up with for **comfort**?

"Jason, I neeeed you to understaaaaand how _fucking hot_ she is," Bella slurred, trying (somewhat unsuccessfully) to stay on her stool. The latest hits of three years ago pumped over the bar speakers at barely-tolerable volumes, but Bella didn't mind. "Like, gawd." Standing up and planting her butt on the seat, she dropped her head on her folded arms. "Shmm nmmm wann ee wmm a rmm ike ee."

"Bella, you're sloshed and you're talking to the bar. Head up and say that again." Jason chided, his trademark eyeroll capping the sentence. "I can't understand a single word you're saying."

"She'd never want to be with a girl like meeee!" Bella wailed before dropping her head into her arms again. "Shmm mm mmmm."

"Oh my god, Bella. You're pathetic." Jason took a sip of his drink, scowled at it, and stole a sip of her Long Island.

"I said she's too cute," Bella moaned before reaching for the glass that had mysteriously moved. She didn't notice. "She's like, cute and so _shy_ and she's got this _nose_ that I just want to bite but not in a bad way it's just so cute and--"

Jason sighed and started to get up. "I knew that last drink was a mistake." Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a few bills, glanced at them, and threw them on the bar. "Come on, Bella. Do I have to carry you out?"

"--and her EARS and the way that her EYES just say SO MUCH and--"

"Right, okay," he grunted. Wrapping his arms around his little sister, he spun her off the stool and got her standing, only to catch her as she fell into him.

"--but like what if she doesn't like me? What if she doesn't look at meeee?" Tears sprung from her eyes as the alcohol-fueled waterworks started while she groped blindly for a handhold.

"I'm never letting you get Southern Comfort again. You're a disgrace." Grabbing her torso, he bodily lifted her off the floor and held her upright.

"Am I at least a CUTE disgrace?" she sobbed into his ear.

"You're an adorable disgrace," he responded.
