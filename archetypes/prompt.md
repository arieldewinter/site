STORY

[^1]: The prompts are selected on a rotating basis by my friends in Discord! The rules are simple:
    * It can be any word, idea, or concept
    * Keep it interesting within the 2000-character limit that Discord imposes on a single message
    * Keep the editing to an absolute minimum
    
    You should give it a try too -- they're fantastic opportunities to practice storytelling in a small window of time. What can you come up with for **{{ replace .Name "-" " " }}**?
